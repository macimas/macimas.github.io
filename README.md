hi hello welcome to my website's horrific repo with spaghetti code

## questions nobody asked

**Q: How do I run this?**
<br>
A: ok so:

1. install npm/pnpm/deno/whatever thing that does javascript magic
2. install dependencies
3. execute the `dev` task in your thing
4. open up the url that shows up
5. gaze upon the website

**Q: That doesn't help me at all.**
<br>
A: that is not a question
